# JS-Logify
JS-Logify is a [bookmarklet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet) to convert logic expression in _similar_ [ASCII](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascii) formatting to proper unicode logic runes.

# Installation

Go to the [installation page](http://smizrahi.fedorapeople.org/js-logify/install.html).

# How to use

Write the expression in semi-similar ascii. Select the expression using the mouse and click on the Logify bookmarklet.

If you are mixing expression with RTL languages (like Hebrew and Arabic) you might find that it's hard to write the expression correctly because of alignment issues.
To solve this:

1. Put () where you intend to write you expression.
2. Select the "()" and Logify it
3. Start writing inside the paranthesis.

You'll see that charechters are now aligned as expcted.

# Mappings

Putting the ASCII charecters on the left will produce the logic symbol on the right.

* ~,! = ‎¬‎
* V = ‎∨‎
* ^,& = ‎∧‎
* -> = ‎→‎
* <->,<=> = ‎↔‎
* = = ‎≡‎
